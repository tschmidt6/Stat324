Why is it a limitation in the original Marshmallow Test study (discussed in the Atlantic article) that the only students studied were those enrolled in a Stanford preschool?
	* The students enrolled in the Stanford preschool may be systematically different from preschoolers in general. *

	It is not a limitation - those students are a simple random sample of all preschool students.

Which of the following statements are true for all sets of data with more than 2 data values? (Select all that apply).

	The range will always be positive.
	* The standard deviation will always be nonnegative. *
	The mean is always larger than the standard deviation.

Suppose a set of 10 values has a mean of 5, sample standard deviation of 3 and a minimum value of 1.5. If that minimum value of 1.5 is changed to 1, which of the following statements are true. Select all that apply.

	* The standard deviation will increase *
	The range will decrease
	The IQR will increase
	* The mean will decrease *
	The median will decrease

Which of the following statistics cannot be determined directly from a boxplot?
	Median
	* Mean *
	Range
	Interquartile Range
	Third Quartile

For what shaped distribution (histogram of data) does the mean often have a greater value than the median?

	Symmetric
	Left Skewed
	* Right Skewed *
	bimodal

Why should you resist the urge to use an angled 3D pie chart? (Use linked article for info/example if you wish)
	You shouldn't resist. They offer clear and concise summary of categorical data.
	They are only useful for categorical data and scientists are only interested in numeric data.
	* They can distort the relative sizes of the relative percent within each category. *
	A box plot can present the same information in a more clear way.

Specify the order of box plots that matches the order of histograms a, b, c.

	Sometimes
	Never

Suppose that start-up companies in the area of biotechnology have probability 0.2 of becoming profitable and that those in the area of information technology have probability of 0.15 of becoming profitable. A venture capitalist invests in one firm of each type. Assume the companies function independently. What is the probability that at least one of the two companies become profitable?
	a. 0.15*0.2
	b. 1-0.15*0.20
	c. 0.85*0.8
	d. 1-0.85*0.8
	e. 0.2+0.15-0.2*0.15
	f. 0.8+0.85-0.80*0.85
	* g. d and e *
	h. both b and f

Choose which of the pair of events below best matches the assumption of independent events. (Though arguments can be made that none of them are exactly independent)

	Event A: dam at top of WI River fails; Event B: dam at bottom of WI River fails
	Event A: Father's height is above average; Event B: Son's height is above average
	Event A: GEs stock price yesterday increases; Event B: GE's stock price today increases
	* Event A: Length of first Bluegill caught fishing this weekend in the WI River is over 6 inches; Event B: Length of second Bluegill caught this weekend in WI River is over 6 inches *
